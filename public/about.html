<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Amal Jacob Kuruvilla, a passionate and aspiring full-stack developer currently focused on mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). With a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering and professional experience as an Implementation and Support Associate, I've decided to pivot into the dynamic world of web development.
</p>
I'm driven by a love for technology and problem-solving, which led me to pursue this exciting journey into software development. I'm continuously learning new skills, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript, and diving deep into building responsive, user-friendly web applications.

<p>When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring the latest tech trends, working on personal projects, or enjoying a good TV show. I'm also focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and am working toward fitness goals like achieving a six-pack!
</p>
I'm always open to new opportunities and connections, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about tech!
